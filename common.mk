# Target board/hardware (BSP).
# To change the target, it is recommended to use the Library manager
# ('make library-manager' from command line), which will also update Eclipse IDE launch
# configurations.
TARGET=APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2

# Name of toolchain to use. Options include:
#
# GCC_ARM -- GCC provided with ModusToolbox software
# ARM     -- ARM Compiler (must be installed separately)
# IAR     -- IAR Compiler (must be installed separately)
#
# See also: CY_COMPILER_PATH below
TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM

# Default build configuration. Options include:
#
# Debug -- build with minimal optimizations, focus on debugging.
# Release -- build with full optimizations
# Custom -- build with custom configuration, set the optimization flag in CFLAGS
# 
# If CONFIG is manually edited, ensure to update or regenerate launch configurations 
# for your IDE.

# Building ifx-mcuboot with ARM compiler requries some
# specific symbols. However, linking when ifx-mcuboot is 
# added as a library to an existing project,
# those symbols are not required. Excluding those symbols, 
#which are not needed for this application build
